Reshef, Dani and Yoav secretly have a *Hentai loving club* club.
The three boys ALWAYS like to stack body pillows.
They like them so much that each club member volunteers
to bring up to *P(per club member)* random body pillows every day.
However, to keep up the excitement, every day only *1* club member
is permitted to bring his body pillows to their meeting.

In addition, the three boys get tired of seeing the same body pillows each day,
so they thought of way to do it:
Every day, a different club member must bring his body pillows to the meeting.
There is one single constraint, each club member must bring
his body pillows *AT LEAST* once.

Calculate the maximum amount of body pillows the *Hentai loving club* club
can see under the given constraints.

Input
=====
The first line denotes the amount of test cases (1 <= t <= 10 ^ 5).
Each of the test cases contain 1 line with 4 numbers:
r, d, y, g (1 <= r, d, y, g <= 10 ^ 6) - the amount of body pillows
that Reshef, Dani and Yoav may bring every day. g - the amount of days
the club will be meeting.

Output
======
For each test case, output 1 number: the maximum amount of body pillows they
can see under the given constraints. Print -1 if this is impossible.

Example
=======
3
3 2 1 3
4 6 5 2
20 10 15 5

Answer
======
6
-1
80

Explanation
===========
A possible solution for the first test case is that Reshef, Dani and Yoav
bring their body pillows in that order. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

In the second test case there are not enough days for each of the club member
to bring in their body pillows.

In the last test case, they will bring their body pillows in this order:
Reshef -> Yoav -> Dani -> Yoav -> Reshef.
