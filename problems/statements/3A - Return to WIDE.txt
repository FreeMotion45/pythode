Dani has rejected humanity, and wants to return to WIDE.
Since he only recently thought of it he has  WIDEness score of 0.
To get himself back to WIDE he needs to pass a series of bridges and roads.
A block of bridge is denoted by a `0` and a block of road is denoted by `1`.
Bridges, unlike roads, tend to wiggle whenever someone is passing over them.
Because of that, Dani can't get any WIDE score when he is on them.
Roads however, have a good foundation, so when Dani passes them he can safely
gain WIDE score.

However, Dani has anxiety.
Due to this, he can start gaining WIDE score after feeling safe.
Dani doesn't feel safe, until he has walked the same amount of blocks,
as the length of the last bridge passed.

To motivate Dani, help him by calculating his WIDEness score when he reaches the end
of his journey.

Input
=====
The first line contains a single number t (1 <= t <= 10 ^ 4), denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single number b (1 <= b <= 10 ^ 4), denting the number of blocks in his journey,
then *b* characters follow. Where bridge blocks are denoted by `0`, and road blocks by `1`.

Output
======
For each test case output a single number denoting Dani`s WIDEness score at the end of his journey.

Example
=======
2
14
11011000111011
17
00001110001100111

Explanation
===========
In the first test case, Dani walks on the road gaining *2* WIDE score.
He then walks on a bridge for 1 block. He returns to the road, and walks another block.
Since Dani walked on a bridge for 1 block, he needs to pass the same amount of blocks on a road,
so he doesn't receive any WIDE score for the first block after the bridge, but does receive one
for the next block (Dani won't feel anxious, as he walked the same amount of blocks on a road,
as the last bridge he passed).
Following the same logic, the final answer will be: 4

In the second test case, Dani will only gain WIDEness score on the last block of the road,
earning him a whopping amount of *1* WIDEness score.
