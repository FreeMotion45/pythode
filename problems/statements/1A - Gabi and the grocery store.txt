Gabi wants to buy some cool items from the grocery shop.
Lucky for Gabi, he received tickets that let him choose any item from the grocery store.
Gabi can exchange each ticket for exactly 1 item, without paying any money.

Given an array of the amount of times each item exists and the grocery store and its price,
Gabi wants to know the maximal amount of money he can save.

Inputs
======
The first line contains two numbers N, T (1 <= N, T <= 10^5),
N - denoting how many types of groceries there are, T - the amount of tickets Gabi has.
In each subsequent N lines there are two numbers A, C (1 <= A, C <= 10^5).
A - the amount of times the item exists, C - the cost of a single item.

Output
======
Output a single number denoting the maximum amount of money Gabi can save.

Example 1
=========
5 3
1 5
1 7
10 1
2 8
1 6

Answer = 8 * 2 + 7 = 23
Gabi will buy the two items whose cost is 8, and one item whose cost is 7.

Example 2
=========
3 4
1 10
1 20
1 30

Answer = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
Gabi has more tickets that available items, so he will buy every single item at the store.
