# Introduction

Pythode is a small repository and a small project I made over the weekend.
Its purpose is to be a very minimal and friendly CLI in which you can 
solve algorithmic questions & puzzles.

Its somewhat like Codeforces, Hackerrank and all of those kinds.
Made this mostly because I was looking for a little side project
to make and this is what I came up with.

# Get started
Make sure you have `Python 3.7` installed and that if you type `python --version` in the CMD / Terminal
that you get the correct version. Then whenever you're feeling ready, open this repo and run
`python main.py`.
